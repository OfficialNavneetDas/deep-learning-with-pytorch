# 🚀 PyTorch Learning Journey

This repository is a dedicated space for my notes and code implementations as I learn **PyTorch**. Each notebook represents a module or a specific concept I've explored while following CampusX.

## 📚 Contents
The notebooks are organized by topic to make it easy to revisit specific Deep Learning concepts:

* **01_pytorch_fundamentals:** Tensors, Datatypes, Mathematical Operations, numpy and pytorch, special Function, and Tensor operations on GPUs.
* **02_Automatic Differentiation** Basic Steps, Backward Tracking and Finding Gradient, and Disable Gradient Tracking
* **03_workflow (Training Pipeline):** Data loading, Preprocessing, Building a model, Training loops, Model Evaluation, and inference.
* **04_neural_network_classification:** Making NN with Hiddan Layers,BUILT-IN Lossfunction and Optimizer,  Building multi-class and binary classifiers.
* **05_Datasets and dataloaders**
* <hr>
* **04_computer_vision:** Working with `torchvision`, CNNs, and image data.
* **05_custom_datasets:** Learning how to load your own data into PyTorch.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Library:** PyTorch
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
